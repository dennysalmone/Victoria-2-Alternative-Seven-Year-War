The Great Powers are fearful of this prospect and have offered to help us to definitively demark the border and settle all remaining disputes for once and all.

EVTNAME190300;A New Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190300;A new heretical religious movement is forming in our lands, as a man proclaiming himself 'the Bab' is doing away with the old interpretations of the Quran. Instead he is offering his own interpretation of the text, looking for hidden meaning behind every individual letter. His radical new interpretation already sits poorly with the ulama -the religious authorities-, but his claim to authority to do so is what really infuriates them. He claims that the Qa'im [the redeemer] has arrived and that his is in contact with Him [he is the gate -Bab- to the Qa'im].\n\nNot satisfied with proclaiming himself just the Bab, in his rising popularity he is now proclaiming that he is indeed the Qa'im himself. And as Qa'im he has the authority to abrogate the Sharia. An act which was pushing it to far for the ulama: They have declared his movement heretical and are demanding that the Bab be put to death as an apostate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190301;He Whom God Shall Make Manifest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190301;One of the core teachings of the heretic the Bab is the imminent arrival of 'He whom God shall make manifest', or the messiah who shall establish God's kingdom on Earth. Long have the Babis been on the lookout for such a man, and now one by the name of Baha'u'llah claims to be him. While incarcerated in the Siyah-Chal prison, he claims to have had a a vision from the 'Maid of Heaven' proclaiming him the 'best beloved of the worlds' and having the 'power of the Sovereign within him.' In other words, he is the one prophesied.\n\nBaha'u'llah's claim is rapidly gaining acceptance among the Babis, and his presence in our realm is sure to reinvigorate the Babi cause and increase their militancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190302;The Babi faith is a radical renewal of the Islamic faith, and has been condemned in $FROMCOUNTRY$ as heretical. Under pressure from the conservative clergy, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ state has taken to violently repressing this new faith. As such many of the Babi adherends are fleeing $FROMCOUNTRY$, and some have found a safe haven in our realm. Amongst these people is a man named Baha'u'llah, who claims to the fulfilment of the Babi prophecy of there coming a man 'whom God shall make manifest' and restore the kingdom of God to Earth. With this claim he is rapidly absorbing leadership of the Babi movement and turning it into the Baha'i Faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190303;A prominent scholar belonging to the herretical Baha'i sect has taken up residence in $PROVINCENAME$. An expert in Islamic scripture and jurisprudence, his knowledge has allowed him to establish himself as a religious authority in $PROVINCENAME$. People flock to him for advice and rulings. With his growing influence grows his ability to convert people away from the true path and unto the herretical Baha'i path. Not only does this mean he is leading people to eternal damnation, the Baha'i have shown themselves to be enemies of the state and their growth is a threat to the stability of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190304;The Tobacco Fields of Persia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190304;Ever since tobacco was introduced into Persia last century, the Persians have taken a great liking to its use. It has become a staple of life for both men and women: many men spending their spare time in the great coffee houses smoking. It should come as no surprise then that tobacco cultivation has taken off massively in Persia, with over 200,000 people employed in the sector at this moment. Blessed with excellent soil and a good climate the Persian tobacco is of excellent quality. As a result some of the varieties of Persian tobacco are much prized in foreign markets. Yet until this moment in time there has been no foreign penetration of the tobacco trade in Persia: the entire market is still controlled by the Persians themselves.\n\nA group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ entrepeneurs have now taken it upon themselves to change this, and are looking to enter into a deal with the Shah to gain control over the tobacco trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Blessed with excellent soil and a good climate the Persian tobacco is of excellent quality. As a result some of the varieties of our tobacco are much prized in foreign markets.\n\nWe've been approached by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ merchants hoping to get a concession to enter the market. In exchange for the exclusive rights to the purchasing and selling of tobacco, they offer us a significant boost to our treasury. However, giving how intertwined tobacco is with our culture, handing this industry over to foreigners might not sit well with our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190306;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Interferes in Persia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190306;Our legation in Tehran reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s are vying for a new trade concession in Persia. They have approached the Shah with an offer to take over the complete tobacco trade, from directly buying it from producers to selling it to users, both in Persia and abroad. As Persia produces a number of tobacco varieties much prized in Western markets, if the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s manage to secure this concession it is sure to become a profitable undertaking for them. However, given the deep roots the usage of tobacco has in Persian culture, a disruption of the supply networks could cause significant social unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190307;No Tobacco Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190307;Despite the best efforts of our entrepreneurs to enter into an amicable deal with the Shah of Persia, it seems he fears that interceding in the tobacco trade will cause civil unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190308;'In the name of God the Merciful, the Forgiving. Today the use of tunbaku and tobacco, in whatever fashion, is reckoned as war against the Imam of the Age (may God hasten his glad advent)' -Mohammad Hasan Shirazi.\n\nProminent members of the ulama have issued fatwas condemning the buying and selling of tobacco from infidels and kafirs to be haram.\n\nSurely this is nothing but a effort for the ulama to undermine the Tobacco Regie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190309;The Tobacco Protests;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190309;'Most Persian would rather forego bread than tobacco, and the first thing they would do at the breaking of the fast during the month of Ramadan was to light their pipes.' -European observer\n\nFeeling their livelyhood threatend by the Tobacco Regie, the bazaari have come out in protest against it en mass. While previously such protests remained a local affair -as the ulama could be counted on to quell the unrest- the current protests are of a different order. With the help of the anjomans (secret societies) the bazaari have mobilised popular support nationwide, while the ulama seems -following the infamous tobacco fatwa- to have a change of heart and are now coming out against the Regie. In line with the fatwa and ulama, many have no sworn to forgo smoking, including the leading Mujtahed Ashtiyani. Such is the extend of the protests that even the harem ladies forgo smoking, and our servents no longer prepare the water pipe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190310;'Most Persian would rather forego bread than tobacco, and the first thing they would do at the breaking of the fast during the month of Ramadan was to light their pipes.' -European observer\n\nThe Tobacco Regie has long been unpopular with the Persian peoples, but the Shah has managed to keep control with the help of his clergy. This all changed when a promiment religious scholar issued a fatwa (religious rulling) declaring it forbidden for Muslims to consume tobacco sold by 'infidels' and 'foreigners'. Since then the - previously allied to our interests - clergy have joined in the protest, and many in Persia have stopped smoking. Such is the extend of the protests that even the Shah's harem ladies refuse to smoke, and his servents refuse to prepare his water pipe. Faced with such popular opposition, the Shah saw no other choice but to rescind the Tobacco Regie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190311;The Plot of Amir Kabir;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190311;Amir Kabir has shown himself to be an administative reformer without equal. Throughout his tenure he passed a wide variety of administrative, cultural, and economic reforms, most immediately a vaccination campaign against smallpox. While his reforms have proven to be valuable for the realm, it is not without its opposition. One of the most thorough reforms has been of the civil service, with salaries reduced and many superfluous offices abolished. This has greatly reduced expenses and strengthened the position of the central government, but it has also upset a large number of nobles who lost their patronage. Together with Tanzimat inspired breaking of the ulama, the reforms have given the central government undisputed authority. But not just of the central authority, but also of Amir Kabir. He is slowly becoming the government himself. Persistance rumours exist that these reforms have been passed to pave the way for Amir Kabir's ascession as Shah...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190312;Renovations of the Golestan Palace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190312;The Golenstan Palace in Tehran was build during the reign of Tahmasp I of the Safavid dynasty. It was last renovated by during the Zand dynasty, before Tehran was even selected as capital and Golestan became the official seat of government. As such the palace can no longer be considered fit for purpose as our seat of government and desperately needs to be expanded. To the east of the current palace there is an large empty lot which is just asking for the palace to be expanded upon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190313;The Death of Mohammad Shah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190313;The Shah has died today at the age of 40. Throughout his life Mohammed had been known to be somewhat sickly, and he finally died from complications arising from his gout in the Mohammadieh Palace. Mohammed was the son of Abbas Mirza and became crown prince upon his father's unexpected passing. Mohammed is succeeded by Naser-Al-Din.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190314;Jamal al-Din al-Afghani;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190314;'How very strange it is that the Moslems study those sciences that are ascribed to Aristotle with the greatest delight, as if Aristotle were one of the Moslems. However, if the discussion relates to Galileo, Newton, and Kepler, they consider them infidels. The father and the mother of science is proof, and proof is neither Aristotle nor Galileo. The truth is there is proof, and those who forbid science and knowledge in the belief that they are safeguarding the Islamic religion are really enemies of that religion.'\nThe famous reformer and political activist Jamal al-Din al-Afghani has decided to offer his services to your court. An outspoken critic of Western Imperialism, he advocates a reformed Islamic faith and pan-Islamic unity as the only way of staving of foreign domination. He argues that this can only be achieved by adopting a rationist mindset and fully embracing modern science. Though his reformist mindset has let to accusations of atheism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190315;The Assassination of Naser al-Din;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190315;The Shah has been assassinated! Shot while visiting and praying at the shrine of Shah-Abdol-Azim. Shot with an old and rusty revolver. Shot by a man called Mirza Reza Kermani. During his public interrogation Mirza Reza revealed that the act was retribution for the ill treatment al-Afghani received at our court, as well as the inept and corrupt rule of the Shah. While most people abhor the murder of the Shah, there is some sympathy for Mirza Reza. For the Shah had long been thought of as selling the country to the infidel with his concessionary politics.\n\nThe Shah is succeeded by Mozaffar ad-Din Shah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190316;The Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190316;The Zoroastianers follow the ancient monotheistic teachings of the prophet Zoroaster. While in its heyday it was the state religion of the Persian Empire and had millions of followers, over the centuries the numbers dwindled and it the religion was slowely replaced by Islam as the religion of the Persian people. However, there are still those who practise this ancient religion in our empire. Being subject to the jizya as well as harrasment by Muslims, they are subject to both formal and informal persecution.\n\nThe Parsi people -Zoroastrian co-religionists from India- are appalled by the deplorable situation Zoroastrianists find themselves in our empire. To assist them they founded the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund offering financial support to them. A Parsi embassy lead by Maneckji Limji Hataria has also arrived at court pleading the end of persecution of the Zoroastrianists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190317;Old and Modern Tehran;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190317;Tehran is undergoing growth and modernisation at a rapid pace. It is quickly becoming a metropolis worthy of our Empire. But with this growth and modernisation comes the need to replace older and outdated buildings, there is not unlimited supply of land of course. Eyes have fallen on the Golenstan Palace for redevelopment. It occupies a large section of the city, and was last renovated during the reigh of Naser-Al-Din Shah. It is old and starting to become dilapilated, not to mention is starting to look dated. Clearing out the palace would allow for the construction of a modern city in its place, or we could maintain it as a testatment to the history of our Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190318;The Persian Imperial Bank;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190318;Currently the economy can only be described as 'medieval.' The only form of currency currently in circulation are silver and gold coins. While -as charging interest is forbidden by Islamic law- the only money lenders are Jewish sarrafs. Who, due to this as well as cultural ties, dominate the money market. Modern financial instruments such as those known in the West are completely absent from the economy. Without access to easy credit and finance there has been little investment in the country and economic development has been stagnant.\nSensing an opportunity to both make money and strengthen Persia, we've been approached by Baron de Reuter who proposes the founding of a modern -Western- financial institution: the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Imperial Bank. By mobilising the savings of the Persian people capital would become available for the development of the country. In exchange Baron de Reuter ask for exclusive banking rights and mining concessions for all newly discovered mineral deposits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190319;The Great Famine of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190319;The past winter the rains have utterly failed, with only the southern and western provinces being blessed with any precipitation at all. Other regions haven't seen a single drop of rain in over two years. This has left the land scorch dry as not even rivers and wells can supply enough water to maintain farming levels. As harvests fail a major famine is developing. Bread is getting scarcer resulting in the price of bread doubling in Tehran, tripling in Isfahan and increasing more than 20 fold in some rural areas. As a result of these high prices those still holding grain have started hoarding their supply in the hopes of fetching a premium. Reports have reached us that one provincial governor banned the import of grain in the hopes of driving up the value of his own stock.\n\nThis all resulted in the common people starving and bread riots being a daily occurance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

This Mirza Ghulam Ahmad fellow mananges to convince may with his deep knowledge of theology, both Christian and Islamic, and orating skills. Apparently he spend a great deal of his youth studying Christian and Islamic texts, while also debating Christian missionaries earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190322;The Ahmaddiyya Muslim Jama'at;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190322;Some time ago a fellow by the name of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad started proclaiming himself the Mujaddid in one of our provinces in India. Not satisfied with his claim of being the devinely inspired reformer of Islam, he has now added to his claim the assertion that he is the Mahdi, the promised Messiah. Apparently, he is quite successful with his claims, as he rapidly gained a following. Even managing to extract a personal pledge of allegiance from 40 followers. With it he has founded his own faith community: The Ahmaddiyya Muslim Jama'at.\nHowever, while he may be gaining followers, not everybody is convinced of claim to be the Mahdi. Many consider him to be a heretic and are demanding that his works be condemned: a fatwa declaring him a kafir, liar and deceiver was signed by over 200 clergymen. While a religious opinion issued by scholars at Mecca and Medina declare Ghulam Ahmad's beliefs blasphemous and tantamount to apostasy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190323;Amir Arsalan-e Namdar\n[The Story of Arsalan];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190323;Our chief story teller has composed a new story for our entertainment: the Amir Arsalan-e Namdar\n\nArsalan was born after his pregnant mother -queen of Roum- was forced to flee her kingdom. She becomes wedded to an Egyptian merchant and gives birth to her child, Arsalan. The merchant claims the child as his own. Naturally Arsalan learns the truth of his royal origin, and sets out to avenge his father and reclaim his throne. Later he falls in love with Farrok-leqa, who is later killed, revived and carried of by a hand from the clouds. A series of adventures, including being saved from the gallows by an afreet, leads him to another land where he is reunited with Farrok-leqa. And they live happily ever after.\n\nThe story has become a court favourite, with the Shah's daughter transcribing the story herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190324;A Cup of Tea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190324;For a long period of time coffee had been the national drink of our people. With smoking in coffee houses being a national past time. However As most coffee producing regions are located far away, making shipping difficult and expensive, it is a pleasure few can afford. As the the tea producing regions of India and China are nearer to $COUNTRY$, tea has proven tea highly priced -cheaper- alternative to coffee. This has caused a gradual shift away from coffee towards tea over the past the decades, leaving tea the national drink\n\nBut like coffee, tea still has to be imported. To remedy this it has been suggested we start our own tea plantations. The region around Rasht, with its mild weather, plenty of precipitation and good -slightly acidic- soil, seems to be a good contendor. However, as tea is one of the most valuable produces of British India, the British might not take well to us establishing our own tea industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190325;The Persian army's performance in relation to its Western counterparts has so far proven to be less than satisfactionary. Even the elite Royal Cavalry has dissappointed. Western observers who have observed them have often derisively commented on their preformance, calling them 'untrained and undisciplined'.\nDuring our travels in Europe the Russian Cossacks displayed particular rigor in their skill and ability. It has been suggested we apply for Russian support, and start training our own Caucasian population in the manner of the Russian Cossack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190326;A Promising Officer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190326;The Persian Cossacks have proven to be the most effective military unit in our arsenal. As such it has become a proving ground for young and ambitious officers. Originally not a path for political advancement -orginally only Caucasian muhajirs could become officers, often through inheritence-, but with Persians now swelling the ranks the Cossacks have become a recruiting ground for political talent. One particular officer -by the name of Reza Khan- has caught attention. Said to be highly intelligent and extremely charasmatic. He has a keen mind for matters of state and modernising the establishment and, with some support, he could go far in our administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190327;The Constitutional Revolution has left our central authority fractured and weakend. A power vacuum has emerged in the country side which is leading to distrubances. Without central authority, bandits are left free to roam. Such a burden to commerce have these bandits become that the British are now demanding we either deal with, or accept that they will.\n\nLacking a effective police force to deal with the bandits, it has been suggested we contact a neutral European power for help to establish a highway gendarmerie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190328;Our dire financial situation and general weakness has left our court to be behold of foreign interests, with the Shah being little more than a figurehead while infidels run the country. Infidels to whom our natural resources are being pandered, and all to pay of debts caused by government extravagance. Instead of investing in and strengthening the country, the whole system seems to only serve to enrich the rich and impoverish the common folk.\nThe repaying of foreign debt has become quite the contentious issue, especially among the bazaari. Protests against high taxes and tariffs are common, but the bastinadoing of a bazaari for a minor offence has made things come to a head. Massive protests have broken out all over Tehran, and the bazaari have -with the full support of the ulama- closed down the bazaar! Their demands: The removal of offending government figures, the implementation of a constitution and the creation of a parliament to oversee the government financing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However, by now the revolutionaries feel that the real problem in Persia is the domination of government by the nobility and aristocracy.

Commander Reza Khan has taken his detachment of Cossacks to Tehran and, with little bloodshed, forced the dissolution of the Majles and his own installation as minister of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190338;'Escorted by his generals and his ministers bearing jewels and regalia, the aigrette in his cap blazing with the diamond known as the Mountain of Light, wearing a blue cloak heavy with pearls, the Shah advanced towards the Peacock Throne. The European women curtsied to the ground: the men inclined themselves low on his passage: the mullahs shambled forward in a rapacious, propriety wave: the little prince, frightened, possessed himself of a corner of his father's cloak. ... With his own hands he removed the cap from his head, with his own hands he raised and assumed the crown, while two ministers stood by, holding the dishonored tiaras of the Kajar dynasty. Then from outside came a salvo of gun, making the windows rattle, proclaiming to the crowds in the streets that Reza Khan was King of Kings and the Centre of the Universe.' -Vita Sackville-West\nThe majles have formally deposed the last Qajar Shah and installed Reza Pahlavi as Shah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190340;While riding briefly ahead of the royal guards a small group of angry Babis approached the Shah, ostensibly with a petition demanding redress for the insult done by the execution of the Bab.\nBut the petition was but a ruse! One Babi grabbed the reins of the Shah's horse and fired a him. At the same time a second babi opened fire as well. The Mustawfi al-Mamalik reacted promptly and pulled the Shah from his horse, but that did not save him from a third assassin who jumped the Shah with a dagger.\n\nThe royal entourage, watching from a distance, were slow to react. Some even panicking and racing back to Tehran, bringing with them the news and spreading fear of a general Babi uprising.\nBut the Shah lives, suffering only minor scratches during his ordeal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190344;A concession we granted to a British baron by the name of Julius de Reuter is causing quite a stir among the populace. Under the terms of the concession baron de Reuter has the sole right to exploit all new forests, mines and industry. In exchange building a railroad and providing the treasury with a fixed sum for 5 years plus 60% of net revuenue for 20 years.\nTo the populace this is evidence that the country is slowly being taken over by kafirs, and not just any kind of kafir, but a Jew of all people. This has resulted the ulama to uniting in opposition to the concession. They have succeeded in convincing the people that this concession will bring with it infidels and moral corruption.\nThe Russian Legation has also come out against this concession. Giving such sweeping power to a single person is irreconcilable with their interest, and they will not accept it.\nLastly, the British government has made it know that they cannot support this concession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Recent events in Shiraz exceed the normal level animosity by a fair margin though.\nTrouble started when a copy of the Holy Quran was found in cesspool of a Jewish home. Something which can only be considered a clear provocation by the Muslims populace, though some claim it was a veiled women who put it there. The next day a bazaari came forth and claimed his daughter was taken by Jews and killed for her blood. A claim enraging the crowd which made for the Jewish quarter the following day. Yet it were the soldiers who were sent to protect the Jews who were the first to loot.\nLooting lasting for 7 hours, leaving 12 Jews killed, 50 injured and 6000 bereft of property.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190347;'Most Persian would rather forego bread than tobacco, and the first thing they would do at the breaking of the fast during the month of Ramadan was to light their pipes.' -European observer\n\nWhen the religious authorities issued a fatwa banning smoking, many happily obliged in an effort to rid the country of the Tobacco Regie and the foreign domination coming with it. However, while most enthusiasticly joined in, as the ban dragged on many found that stopping smoking was more difficult than anticipated. Not only is smoking thoroughly ingrained in Persian culture, it is also terribly addictive. As time wore on slowly people started circumventing the ban and started smoking again. As the fatwa lost influence, so did the hold of the ulama on the people decline. By now few still participate in the protests and most have, begrudgingly, accepted the reality of the Tobacco Regie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190348;The junction in time between the end of one rulers reign and the start of anothers is always a period uncertainty: A period of time of seeing whether the authority of the new ruler will be accepted. Here, at the start of Naser al-Din's reign, two noblemen -Hasah Khan Salar and Ja'far Quli Khan Kurd- have raised the banner of insurrection and are attempting to establish their own fief around Mashhad.\n\nHaving raised their own private army of Turkmen tribesmen, the unsuspected citizens of Mashhad invited Hasah Khan Salat and Ja'far Quli into the city with an eye of quelling ongoing riots. Instead of quelling the riots, though, they turned their attention towards the citadel held by the loyal governor. While the citadel held for some time, it was not supplied to sustain a siege.

Nayeb Isa may have claimed he was fulfilling the people's wishes by removing Said-Mohammed Khan, but his actions are rapidly turning Herat into a lawless place. What is worse, however, is that Nayeb Isa has, without consulting us, executed Said-Mohammed Khan and appropriated his, and all his family's, property. And if executing the rightful, and loyal, governor of Herat wasn't enough, Nayed Isa has refused to pay homage and pledge his loyalty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190355;A change of government took place in Herat recently. The city had been ruled by Said-Mohammed Khan with Persian blessings, but recently he is said to have suffered from bouts of insanity. His rule becoming ever more erratic, his deputy -Nayeb Isa Khan- deposed him. Arguing that was the will of the people to rid them of their insane ruler. However, Herat has always been considered a principality under Persian suzerainty. This change of ruler was not approved by Persia and, what is worse, Nayeb Isa had Said-Mohammed executed and his property confiscated. Such an affront to their honour and authority the Persians could net let slight. They have declared war on Nayeb Isa.\n\nThus far we have considerd this to be an internal matter for the Persians to sort out. However recently we received communications from Nayeb Isa with him begging us to intervene. If we do, he has pledging himself, the principality and the people of Herat to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Topics broached by the journal include the need for strong central authority, the need to control the tribes, equality for women and the need for Western education.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190359;The Unveiled Protest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190359;According to Islamic law it is forbidden for a women to be in contact with a unrelated male, they are even barely allowed to show themselves to unrelated males. This has left women to spend most of their lives in the private world of the family. So engrained in our culture has this become that a common name for a wife is manzel: 'the home.' Rich or poor, women are confined to, and devote their entire lives to, the family. Unless girls are born into well-to-do families, their birth is less enthusiastically welcomed. In some families it has gotten to the point that it is a nang (social disgrace) to give birth to girls.\nYet women are not some mindless automaton, they have a will and mind of their own. Sensing the opportunities the Constitutional Movement -with its focus on modernising- offers, the women of Tehran have now taken to the streets demanding equal treatment. Most notably, they are removing the veil while shouting 'Long live freedom!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190360;The Unveiling;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190360;'Behind the closed doors at home, prohibted from everything in life, education, training and social life, women are regarded as mindless, like infants: they are confined to the burdens of household work and childbearing and are considered the slaves and servants of their husands.'\nThe position of women in our society is poor to say the least. Forbidden by Islamic law to interact with, or even being seen by, unrelated males, women live a hidden life behind closed doors. On the rare occasions that they do venture out, they do so 'wrapped in black bags from head to the toe without even an opening to breathe.' Yet, it would be a mistake to consider women to be powerless bystanders. From the tobacco protests to the Constitutional Revolution, they have been at the forefront of all public protests in recent history. Yet society does not recognise this. Within our modernising government it has been suggested we liberate women from the veil, or at least in public institutions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It is rapidly building a reputation as one of the best literary works in circulation, and it isn't uncommon for people to recite and even sing Nasm-e semal's poems during parties.\n\nNasim-e semal has become a firm defender of the cause of the impoverished, a staunch advocate of social and political reforms and modernization, and a vocal admirer of Islam, particularly Shi'ism; it is also very patriotic, and a zealous supporter of the Constitutional Movement and the constitutional revolutionaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190362;A new satirical journal has been set up in $PROVINCENAME$ and has turned in quite the hit among our Muslim subjects. The journal is named after Molla Nasreddin a 13th century cleric who had a nack for telling amusing tales and anecdotes. The journal, however, is more than just a collection of amusing tales and anecdotes. It is a poignant satire of the clergy and the establishmen and is more than happy to expose its corruption. But more than that, the paper is a call to modernise and accept more advanced Western social norms and practises. It viciously attacks what it preceives to be the backward lifestyles and values of the Islamic clergy and religious fanatics.\nBeing richly illustrated it is not only accessable to the literate elite, but has also become an hit among the lower -illiterate- classes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190363;Published in Tiflis and smuggled across the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ border, Molla Nasreddin is a satirical journal which is rapidly gaining a following in our country. Combining poetry with beautiful illustrations, the journal is not only read by the literate classes but also by the illiterate peasants. All to the chagrin of the ulama. Molla Nasreddin likes nothing more than taking jabs at the ulama's preceived backward lifestyle and values. Contrasting their fanaticism with the enlightend values of the West, the journal calls upon all to throw off the shackles of superstition and adopt advanced Western social normes and practises.\nBut more than an advocate of Westernisation, Molla Nasreddin is a fierce opponent of absolutism and imperialism. It vicously attacks our Qajar dynasty for it corruption and foreign influence, which leaves many starving and the country's natural wealth in the hands of foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME190365;Merchant Councils;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190365;With the growth in foreign trade slowly the tojjar -the prominent merchants- have become the dominant economic players, and not the patrimonial government agents. However power by far and large still resides with the old elites who are thoroughly uninterested in economic reform, and would rather enrich themselves at the expense of the tojjar. We've been approached by a small group of tojjar who are demanding the removal of the ineffective and corrupt Minister of Commerce and replace him with a religious, unbiased and not avaricious official. Futhermore they are demanding we install merchants' assemblies in prominent cities and ports to represent the merchants interests and settle matters of commercial disputes, while promoting commerce and protecting merchants from foreign competition.\nThe old elites, however, feeling threatend in their position, have allied with the the ulama in opposition to the formation of these merchant councils.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190366;The Power of the Ulama;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190366;With the fall of the Safavid dynasty the ulama saw a chance to strengthen its authority. Sharia courts, teachers, priests, even politicians, all rely on the ulama for their position.\n While some may argue that this has provided security and stability in these times of trouble, others have argued that the ulama obstructs modernisation and as such is complicit in the weakend state our empire finds itself. One of the greatest opponents of the ulama is prime-minister Amir Kabir. Who, while working for the border committee insituted by the Second Treaty of Erzurum, closely followed the Tanzimat reforms of the Ottoman Empire and came to the conclusion that the only to modernise and strengthen the empire is by limiting the power and influence of the ulama.\nHe has now proposed measures just to this effect. While it will limit the power of the ulama, expect them to fight it tooth and nail first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The most famous of these is the Faramus-kana: a society founded by Mirza Malkom Khan inspired by the Freemasons of the West. But where the anjoman find fertile ground for growth among the more reform minded classes -and are slowly readying the minds of the general populace for change- the ulama is less than enthusiastic of their ideas. In their eyes many of the anjoman serve to spread corrupt ideas, shelter infidels, promote harmony between Muslims and non-Muslims, and, above all, constitute religious innovation contrary to Islamic precepts. As a result, the ulama is demanding we shut down the anjoman whereever we find them, the Faramus-kana foremost among them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
