EVTDESC300967;Our posts on the Coromandel Coast were established during the 17th and 18th century in an effort to control the Indian trade. However those were different times. By now most of the Indian subcontinent is in $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ hands, and with it most of the Indian trade as well.

EVTNAME300970;The Sale of Saint Barthelemy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC300970;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ bought Saint Barthelemy from us in 1784. The island grew prosperous from the production of cotton, tobacco and sugar, but mostly from its excellent natural harbour. However over time the trade routes have shifted and the once busy harbour is now quiet. With the island no longer as prosperous as it once was, it has become a burden to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ treasury. This has brought the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officials to our door, hoping to negotiate the resale of the island to us.\n\nAre we interested?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC300980;For centuries the migration of nomadic hordes was common sight on the steppes around the black sea. That is until this was forcibly stopped last century, as these migrations put undue pressure on our Baskhir subjects. However, enforcing a complete ban on migration proved difficult, and 'illegal' crossings remained common. Over time these migrations left the area between the Volga and Ural rivers depopulated. This area was only repopulated when a horde under Sultan Bukey was allowed to settle there in 1801 with 7500 families. Today the last the of the Bukey Sultans died, and, under the pledge of fealty which allowed the settlement, the area has naturally reverted back to our direct rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC300998;Baluchistan consists of numerous more or less independent tribes who are loosely confederated under one Great Khan. But even though the Baluchis have never accepted any central authority, we've always considered them to be part of our empire. Recent British efforst however have greatly increased their influence in the region.\n\nTo settle the matter as to whom Baluchistan belongs for once and all, an independent arbitration committee has been called. It has ruled that Kohistan belongs in the Persian sphere of influence, while the rest belongs to the British Raj. There are however some discrepencies how the border is to actually run. If we act quickly we might be able to take advantages of this.\n\n[You've gained a core in Bunpoor and Kussurkund. Bunpoor is safe for you, but the Brits can capture Kussurkund via a CB they have on Markan];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC300999;The Kurdish tribes are fiercely independent, almost to the point of lawlessness and rebellion, and due to the harsh terrain virtually impossible to control. However the divided nature has meant they have been unable to resist our rule. Now a influential chieftan, a man by the name of Sheikh Ubeydullah, has managed to united the tribes on the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ side of the border, and he has now crossed the border to raise support with the tribes on our side.

EVTDESC301001;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s have reasserted their authority over the ports around Lengeh on the northern shore of the Persian Gulf. The ports de jure belonged to $FROMCOUNTRY$, but due to internal and external pressure $FROMCOUNTRY$ had been unable to assert their authority.

Recent changes in the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ administration, however, has given them sufficient influence in the region to reassert their authority over the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301003;The Bandar Abbas Lease;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301003;We've been approached by a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ embassy seeking to renegotiate our lease on the port of Bandar Abbas. It would seem that our recent troubles have emboldened the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s in their stance towards us. The renewed lease they are proposing would see more stringent conditions, a higher fee, the formal recognition of Persian sovereignty over the region[*] and a number cancellation clauses[**]\n\n[*]The recognition is only formal, you will not actually secede Bandar Abbas to $FROMCOUNTRY$\n[**]i.e. bankruptcy, rebellion, revolution and $FROMCOUNTRY$ reaching secondary power and Oman not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME301007;The Treaty of Akhal;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301007;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Grand Designs for Central Asia are starting to interfere with our just claims to the regions. Already the great Khanate of Khiva has been subdued, while it seems only a matter of time untill the other Khanates follow suit. All the while it seems exceedingly unlikely we will be able to turn this trend.\n\nA Russian diplomatic mission has arrived in $CAPITAL$ to discuss just this issue. They propose that, in the interest of avoiding unnecessary conflict, a clear border is defined. The border they are insisting on however would see us loose all our claims and territories in Turkestan. Accepting this proposal would go a long way to stabilise our relations and prevent future conflict. Relinquishing our ancient claims would however also be greatly humiliating and very unpopular at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301008;In their infinite wisdom, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s have agreed to our proposal and will evacuate all territories in Turkestan!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301009;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s seem to understand that resisting our Designs for Central Asia is pointless, and have agreed to withdraw to south of the Atreck River. However, the negotiations did not go smoothly. We may have forced them to withdraw, but some issues have not been resolved which may lead to future conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Turkmen peoples of the Kopet Dag are no different. Ever since we reestablished control over the mountains there has been a slow, but steady, migration of Turkmens to greener pastures, mostly the oasis of Merv.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301014;The Persian attempts to re-establish control over the Kopet Dag mountains have caused a substantial number of Turkmen tribesmen to move north, many of whom have decided to settle in the Merv oasis.

EVTNAME301015;The Treaty of Shiraz;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301015;Without our knowledge or approval the governor of Shiraz has entered into a treaty with the British Resident at Bushire concerning the future of Bahrain. The governor managed to convince the Resident to support our title to the island, and even to offer ships to establish our authority. However word has now reached us from Bombay that the British are refusing to fulfil the terms of the agreement, claiming that, as both the resident of Bushire and the governor of Shiraz exceeded their authority, the treaty of null and void. Without British approval or support, taking Bahrain might prove costly. However, this treaty might prove useful in the future to support our claim to Bahrain.\nHow shall we proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301016;A clandestine treaty was signed recently between the British resident in Bushere and the Persian governor of Shiraz which obligated the British to help the Persians conquer us!

EVTNAME301020;Incident at the Russian Legation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301020;Outrage has erupted over actions of the Russian Envoy in Tehran. Under the terms of the Treaty of Turkmenchay he has granted asylum to an Armenian court eunuch and his extended family. Anti-Russian sentiment which had long been simmering following the recent Russian actions in the Caucasus, have now come to full eruption. An angry mob has gathered at the Russian Legation demanding the return of the eunuch.\n\nEncouraged by opportunistic mullahs, the calls for the return of the Eunuch are growing ever more radical, and the situation is quickly spiralling out of control... Forcing the Envoy to hand over the eunuch would satisfy the crowd, but also anger the Russians. Dispersing the crowd on the other hand would mean accepting this affront to our honour...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301021;Incident at the Tehran Legation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301021;One hour, that is how long they lasted. Alexander Griboyedov and his brave Cossack guards. One hour, in full uniform, before the mob broke through the ceiling and slaughtered all of them. Fighting with pistol, sword, broomstick, anything, they held bravely. All the while the Persian authorities watched. Thrown from the window, decapitated, dragged through the streets and bazaars... Griboyedov's head put on display at a local kebab place, his body identifiable only through a small duelling injury to his finger... And what did Alexander Griboyedov do to deserve this? He rightfully protected an Armenian eunuch and two Georgian girls who wished to escape the imperial harem and move to freedom in Armenia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Russians might, however, have viewed this attack on their legal representative differently, perhaps even angrily. For weeks we have waited on a Russian response, yet none has come. Not even a rider with an official message.\nPerhaps the Russians aren't as fearsome as we thought?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301032;A Persian Adventure;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301032;The Shah of Persia has found himself in somewhat of a pickle after a rousey rabble stormed the Russian Legation in Tehran and killed the envoy Alexander Griboyedov. Apparently Griboyedov stuck his head in some nasty business involving a eunuch and two former harem girls, and the Persians did not take kindly to this. Decapitated, body mutilated, head found on display at a local kebab place, just terrible. The Russians are, understandably, somewhat upset about this, and are threatening war to avenge Griboyedov.
